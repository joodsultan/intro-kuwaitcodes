School and grade: Hayat Universal Billingual School (going to grade 11) 
Why i decided to join this program?
Everyone has something that they're passionate about and love to do without getting bored, it's more than just a thing for me. Sometimes I like to get out and shoot some hoops, sometimes I just want to sit behind the screen and let the time pass by while I'm staring at the screen.  My first encounter with programming was in middle school when I was surfing the net and I stumbled on an app called C++. At that time, I had no idea what it was, so I just did what any kid my age does, googled it. I searched it up and watched a couple of YouTube videos about it. I found it beyond fascinating. Fast forward a couple of years later, my school started teaching us QB64 in ICT class. I loved every second of it.  By joining this program, I would love to enhance and improve my skills in coding. Hopefully one day when I grow up, I can use my skill to improve life around me. “We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works.” - Douglas Adams.
